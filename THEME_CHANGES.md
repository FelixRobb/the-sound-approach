# The Sound Approach App - Theme System Updates

## Overview

The app's theming system has been redesigned to provide a more consistent and flexible experience across light and dark modes. The new theme is based around bright red as the primary color, providing a modern and engaging interface.

## Key Changes

### 1. Theme Structure

- **Enhanced Color Palette**: Created a comprehensive color system with primary red color (`#D32F2F`) and complementary colors.
- **Proper Dark Mode**: Implemented a proper dark theme that works with the system preference.
- **Navigation Theme Integration**: Added support for React Navigation theming to ensure consistent styling across the entire app.

### 2. Theme Hooks

- Created a custom `useThemedStyles` hook that provides easy access to:
  - Current theme object (from React Native Paper)
  - Current mode (light/dark) 

### 3. UI Improvements

- **Enhanced Theme Selector**: Added a visual theme selector in the Profile Settings screen
- **Consistent Styling**: Updated all UI components to use the theme colors
- **Responsive to User Preferences**: App now properly responds to system color scheme changes

### 4. Technical Implementation

The theme system consists of these key components:

- `src/theme.ts`: Defines the light and dark themes
- `src/hooks/useThemedStyles.ts`: Custom hook for accessing theme in components
- `ThemeContext.tsx`: Context provider that manages theme state
- App.tsx: Connects the theme with React Native Paper and React Navigation

## Screens Updated

The following screens have been updated to use the new theme system:

- LoginScreen
- WelcomeScreen
- ProfileSettingsScreen
- All other screens in the app

## How to Use the Theme

To use the theme in a component:

```jsx
import { useThemedStyles } from "../hooks/useThemedStyles"

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { theme, isDarkMode } = useThemedStyles()
  
  // Now you can use theme.colors.primary, etc.
  return (
    <View style={{ backgroundColor: theme.colors.background }}>
      <Text style={{ color: theme.colors.onSurface }}>
        Hello World
      </Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```

## Next Steps

- Further refinement of specific UI components
- Adding more theme-related customization options
- Implementing theme animations for smooth transitions
